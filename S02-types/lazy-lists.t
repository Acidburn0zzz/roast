# L<S09/Lazy lists>

# Tests for lazy lists
#
# TODO - add timeout control, in tests that may loop forever
# TODO - the backends that don't have infinite lists implemented
#        should warn of this, instead of entering an infinite loop.
# TODO - add test for 2D array

# TODO - there used to be tests here (that were never run) for deleting
#        elements from a lazy list. Can't seem to reproduce them with
#        current spec.
