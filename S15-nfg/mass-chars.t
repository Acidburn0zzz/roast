## This test file was superceeded by another. For details, see
## https://github.com/perl6/roast/commit/3baa4db85abfe21d4df1eb9fc1149fd1f30dda
## 
## The reason this dummy exists is to silence missing file warnings in spectest
## run, and we can't remove it from the spectest file list because this file in
## its old form is still part of 6.c-errata
